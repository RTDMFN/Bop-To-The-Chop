# Bop-To-The-Chop

Source code for a rhythm game I made for Ludum Dare 52. The game was made in 24 hours with a partner who worked on the audio and music. Bop To The Chop was my 4th game made in Unity and my third jam entry.

The game can be played on itch at the link below. https://bottledev.itch.io/bop-to-the-chop
